## 🧩 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Modular Encounter Files**
**Decision:** Split encounters into separate files by type  
**Rationale:** Better organization, easier to add content, cleaner git diffs  
**Result:** 4 encounter files (daily, stakeholder, crisis, boss)

### 2. **Base64 Save System**
**Decision:** Client-side save codes instead of server persistence  
**Rationale:** No database needed, portable, privacy-friendly  
**Result:** Simple copy/paste save codes

### 3. **Probability-Based Outcomes**
**Decision:** Each choice has success rate (0.5-1.0)  
**Rationale:** Adds replayability, mirrors real-world uncertainty  
**Result:** Engaging risk/reward decisions

### 4. **7-Level Career Ladder**
**Decision:** APM → PM → Senior → Lead → Director → VP → CPO  
**Rationale:** Mirrors real PM career progression  
**Result:** Clear progression with increasing complexity

### 5. **5 Resource System**
**Decision:** Energy, Credibility, Budget, Morale, Velocity  
**Rationale:** Captures key PM challenges (burnout, influence, resources, team, speed)  
**Result:** Strategic resource management
