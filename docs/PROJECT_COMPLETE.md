# PM Quest: Project Complete ✅

## What We Built

A **complete idle roguelike game** integrated into your terminal resume, featuring the journey of Amit "The Executor" Yogev - the world's most skilled Product Manager - as he climbs from Associate PM to Chief Product Officer.

---

## Game Heritage

### Inspired By: **NetHack + Idle Games**

**From NetHack (1987):**
- Turn-based decision system
- Procedural encounter generation
- ASCII terminal interface
- Save/load with hash codes
- Complex item interactions
- Permadeath consequences
- Deep gameplay systems

**From Idle/Incremental Games:**
- Passive progression mechanics
- Resource management
- Meaningful choices at intervals
- Save codes for portability

**Our PM Divergence:**
- Combat → Strategic PM decisions
- Monsters → Corporate challenges
- Dungeons → Career stages (7 levels)
- Items → PM tools & frameworks
- HP/Mana → Energy/Credibility
- XP → Career progression

### Development Principles

**Test-Driven Development:**
```javascript
// 1. RED: Write test first
it('should level up at correct XP', () => {
  expect(canLevelUp(100, 1)).toBe(true);
});

// 2. GREEN: Make it pass
function canLevelUp(xp, level) {
  return xp >= getXPThreshold(level);
}

// 3. REFACTOR: Improve
```

**Documentation Always:**
- JSDoc for all functions
- User guides for players
- Developer guides for contributors
- Design docs for architecture

**Test Configuration System:**
- `tests/config/test-config.json` - Common settings
- `tests/config/test-results.json` - Aggregated results
- Each test reads config, updates results

**Clean Organization:**
- Minimal root files (10 essential only)
- Game code in `/game` module
- Tests in `/tests` with structure
- Docs in `/docs` organized by audience
